I have already done a couple of internships/trusteeships before ( for more than a year ), the first one was prior to my graduation in Slovakia and the other one was in Paris after I graduated.</p>

                    <p class="my-experiences-bio">Thanks to my jobs/internships abroad, I already got used to different styles, types of architecture, different ways of thinking, design approaches. However, in my opinion in Europe, architecture/design doesn’t change that much from country to country. In the US I had to start from zero because it’s a completely new experience, wooden framing instead of concrete and bricks, different units of measure, a different style ( especially the architecture in Los Angeles ).</p>

                    <p class="my-experiences-bio">Working for a big firm as my host company comes also with more responsibilities, more projects, and opportunities. That’s why it’s pretty common that every employee works on several projects at the same time. It’s very important to manage your time to meet your deadlines. I haven’t had this kind of experience before so it took me some time to get used to it.</p>

                    <p class="my-experiences-bio">Since this is not my first work experience, I’ve been pretty skilled and have been using many different softwares before. However, I knew that the American market is focused mostly on working in Revet. I haven’t used it much before but I’ve learned a lot since my first day here. Now I can say that I’m quite advanced and I have also learned a lot about construction administration and gained some experience in a more technical domain of architecture that will be very useful for me in the future.</p>

                    <p class="my-experiences-bio">Day by day I am given more and more responsibilities and also the freedom to be creative and make my own decisions in the designing process. It has helped me enormously to have the courage to say my opinion, to rediscover my voice as a professional architect, my passion for architecture and motivation to work harder. This opportunity has also made me step out of my comfort zone and helped me to become more confident.</p>
